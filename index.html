		<h1>VT <br/>English <br/>Club <br/></h1>
		<h2>Who we are</h2>
		<p>VT English Club is for students interested in English,whether that be writing or reading, to come together to make friends and share interests.
		We hope to encourage involvement in the department and the Blacksburg community. We also provide students the opportunity to meet and work with
		various faculty members throughout the department in various projects. Each month, we invite a professor or professors to a meeting to discuss
		their research and upcoming courses they'll be teaching. We also hold two annual events, the professor breakfast and trivia night, which gives
		students an opportunity to know their professors in a casual setting.</p>

		<p>The English Club plans to become involved with the NRV reading hour this upcoming year, as well as continue to participate in Trunk or Treat
		and the Angel Tree Program. Each spring, we also have our own team for The Big Event, as well as Relay for Life.</p>

		<p>Overall, our club's goal is also to create friendships, so we plan various excursions for our members to enjoy together.
		This year, we are planning on attending a play at the American Shakespeare Center and visiting the Green Valley Book Fair.<br><br>
		The English Club also works in partnership with the English Honor Society, Sigma Tau Delta.</p>
